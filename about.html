                <h2 class="about-title">ABOUT US</h2>
                <p class="about-para">Head Chef Deepak Sarin has vast experience working in top-rated Indian restaurants in DC, having been a part of the kitchen team in places such as Rasika, <br>Bombay Tandoor in Tysons, and Punjabi by Nature. He's inspired by his mother's Punjabi cooking and has been in this career for over 30 years. He has also worked in Mumbai <br>as well as on Star Cruises, a leading cruise line in the Asia Pacific region. <br><br><br>
                    
                    “A native of Rajasthan, a state in northern India, Sarin has been a journeyman cook, working in kitchens such as Rasika in Penn Quarter, Bombay Tandoor in Tysons and  <br>Punjabi by Nature, the restaurant that preceded KQC in this ground-level space at the Avalon Dunn Loring apartments. Punjabi by Nature owner Rajiv Chopra was <br>looking to sell his lease in Vienna, and Nirali Bhatt and Sarin were interested. They were interested even as negotiations and background checks dragged on from <br>February to June, from pre-shutdown to full-blown pandemic.” <br><br>  
                    ~ KQC Indian Cuisine dares to be different (Hindustan Times) <br><br><br>
                    
                    “If not magic, Sarin, with more than 30 years of experience, has developed a rare understanding of regional Indian cooking. His menu reflects his knowledge. It <br>encompasses Indochinese, Punjabi, Kashmiri and Rajasthani dishes, with other regional specialties promised as the menu progresses.” <br><br>
                    ~ KQC Indian Cuisine dares to be different (Hindustan Times) <br><br><br>
                    
                    “At age 53, Sarin takes no shortcuts with his cooking. The spices and chiles are toasted and ground in-house, as you might expect. But he also rethinks the classics to <br>find small, but significant, ways to refresh their flavors.” <br><br>
